# .NET Cloud Spanner Sample Leaderboard Application

A leaderboard sample that uses the Spanner commit timestamp feature and demonstrates
how to call the [Google Cloud Spanner API](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/)
from C#.

This sample requires [.NET Core 2.0](
    https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) or later.  That means using
[Visual Studio 2017](
    https://www.visualstudio.com/), or the command line.

This sample includes extra directories step5, step6, and step7 that contain partial versions of this sample app. These directories are intended to provide guidance as part of a separate Codelab walk-through where the application is built in the following stages
that correspond to the steps in Codelab:

* step5 - Create the sample database along with the tables Players and Scores.
* step6 - Populate the Players and Scores tables with sample data.
* step7 - Run sample queries including sorting the results by timestamp.

If you only want to run the complete sample refer to the application in the Leaderboard directory.
