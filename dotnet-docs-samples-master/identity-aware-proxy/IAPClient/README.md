# Google Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy Samples

This sample shows how to authenticate an http request when requesting a web page from
a Google App Engine application protected by the [Google Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy](http://cloud.google.com/iap).

This sample requires [.NET Core 2.0](
    https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) or later.  That means using
[Visual Studio 2017](
    https://www.visualstudio.com/), or the command line.

## Build and Run

1.  **Follow the instructions in the [root README](../../README.md)**.

2.  Follow the instructions here
    [https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/app-engine-quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/app-engine-quickstart)
    to create an App Engine application and enable Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP).

3.  Follow the instructions here 
    [https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/authentication-howto](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/authentication-howto#iap-make-request-csharp)
    to download service account credentials and observe your IAP client id.

9.  From a Powershell command line, run to see command line arguments.
    ```
    PS > dotnet run
    IAPClient 1.0.0
    Copyright (C) 2018 IAPClient
    ERROR(S):
    Required option 'u, uri' is missing.

    -j, --credentials    Path to your service account credentials .json file.

    -u, --uri            Required. The URI to fetch.

    -c, --iapcid         Your IAP client id listed on https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

    --help               Display this help screen.

    --version            Display version information.
    ```
    
9.  And pass your own values:
    ```
    PS > dotnet run -- -u https://my-project.appspot.com `
        -c 71377614389-vn0dmho3h2utdus0v3jq9dcf9foj1gph.apps.googleusercontent.com `
