# .NET Cloud IoT Core Sample

This sample demonstrates how to manage registries and devices for the
[Google Cloud IoT Core](https://cloud.google.com/iot-core/docs) product.

This sample requires [.NET Core 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) or
later.  That means using [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/),
or the command line.

## Build and Run

1.  **Follow the instructions in the [root README](../../README.md)**.

2.  Enable APIs for your project.
    [Click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudiot.googleapis.com&showconfirmation=true)
    to visit Cloud Platform Console and enable the Google Cloud IoT Core API.

3. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the
service account JSON from the Google Cloud Console:

```powershell
    PS > $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="creds.json"
```

4. Set the `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID` environment variable:

```powershell
    PS > $env:GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
```

5.  From a Powershell command line, restore the NuGet packages and call
`run` to see a list of subcommands like getRegistry or getDevice:
    ```powershell
    PS C:\...\dotnet-docs-samples\iot\api\CloudIotSample> dotnet restore
    PS C:\...\dotnet-docs-samples\iot\api\CloudIotSample> dotnet run
