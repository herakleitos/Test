# Google Cloud Pub/Sub Sample

This C# sample demonstrates how to call the
[Google Cloud Pub/Sub API](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs) from C#.

This sample requires [.NET Core 2.0](
    https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) or later.  That means using
[Visual Studio 2017](
    https://www.visualstudio.com/), or the command line.  Visual Studio 2015 users
can use [this older sample](
    https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dotnet-docs-samples/tree/vs2015/pubsub/api).

## Build and Run

1.  **Follow the instructions in the [root README](../../README.md)**.

4.  Enable APIs for your project.
    [Click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=pubsub.googleapis.com&showconfirmation=true)
    to visit Cloud Platform Console and enable the Google Stackdriver Cloud Pub/Sub API.

7. Edit [QuickStart.cs](QuickStart/QuickStart.cs), and replace YOUR-PROJECT-ID with the id of the project you created in step 1.

9.  From a Powershell command line, run the QuickStart sample:
    ```
    PS C:\...\dotnet-docs-samples\pubsub\api\QuickStart> dotnet restore
    PS C:\...\dotnet-docs-samples\pubsub\api\QuickStart> dotnet run
    Topic projects/YOUR-PROJECT-ID/topics/my-new-topic created.
    ```

10. And run the Pubsub sample to see a list of subcommands like createTopic and
createSubscription:
    ```
    PS C:\...\dotnet-docs-samples\pubsub\api\PubsubSample> dotnet restore
    PS C:\...\dotnet-docs-samples\pubsub\api\PubsubSample> dotnet run
    Pubsub 1.0.0.0
